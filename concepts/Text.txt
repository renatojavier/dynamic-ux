Challenge

- Many Churches rely on outdated communication tools i.e. print media- Build a comprehensive digital platform that is easy enough for non tech savvy people to use but powerful enough to add value to Church communications- Digitize all Church communications with highly automated software

How we created the platform:

Complexity

Design

We created initial designs and one-off Apps for local Churches.

Feedback & Refinement

Working closely with local parishes, we improved the product and developed a feature roadmap.Implementation

We designed highly automated custom software combining lots of elements to create a great platform, and ran the production team to build it.

Tools
We used many cutting edge tools, frameworks and integrations as components of this platform. Here are a few examples:


FCP X
Laravel
Let’s Encrypt
Framework 7
PhantomJS
Motion
AWS
Adobe CC
Slack
Mandrill
Saltstack
Nexmo
Sass
Git
Stripe
Google API
ImageMagick
Phabricator

Phomio

Challenge
- Create an interactive photo sharing contest platform that facilitates viral marketing for products and services- Automate the system so clients can be as hands off as possible- Show statistics to clients to prove ROI

How we created the platform:

Complexity

Considerations
We anonymize and strip EXIF data from uploaded customer images before posting to any social networks. Some users are unaware that photos taken on smartphones can contain PII location information which is no one else’s business, and we don’t want to share it to social networks without their knowledge.

Details
Phomio has many applications across different business sectors so in order to give the most to clients, we designed special persistent data on a per user basis.For example, a pet groomer used Phomio to for a Pet photo contest. Each pet was randomly assigned a “signature” paw print image. And if two separate submissions had matching pet names and entry email addresses, the paws would be the same for consistency. This all happens behind the scenes so users have it simple, but we do the extra leg work to put in the details.customer_email: email1@domain1.compet_name: Misty

WatchMyBit
Challenge
- Create an on demand delivery video platform - Enable micropayments to unlock video content via Bitcoin transaction- Design a platform that overcomes the reluctance to pay for video content

How we created the platform:
Complexity

Analytics
We designed and helped implement highly sophisticated tracking algorithms. The features of the platform allow users to split payments out to multiple contributors or video producers, and Bitcoin is based on trustless systems so its extremely important our transactions are completely transparent and easy to understand for the user. 

UI
We created many custom user interface elements and widgets to guide users and keep them informed every step of the way.User Facing Video rating chart
